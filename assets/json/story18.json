{"01":"Jesus was out in the country, preaching to thousands of people. When the time came for everyone to go home, Jesus sent the disciples out on a boat to sail to the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowd.","02":"After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he went up on a mountain to pray. Jesus was there all alone, and he prayed long into the evening.","03":"Later, he looked out and saw that the disciples&rsquo; boat was a long way from land. They were in danger, because the boat was being tossed around by the waves and the wind.","04":"Jesus decided to go to them, so he walked on top of the water across the lake toward the boat! Jesus meant to pass by them.","05":"The disciples were very afraid when they saw Jesus, because they thought they were seeing a ghost.","06":"Jesus knew that they were afraid so he called out to them and said, &quot;Do not be afraid. It&rsquo;s me!&quot;","07":"The disciple named Peter then said to Jesus, &quot;Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.&quot; Jesus told Peter &quot;Come!&quot;","08":"So, Peter got out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the surface of the water. But after a short distance, he turned his eyes away from Jesus, and began to look at the strong wind and waves.","09":"Then Peter became afraid and began to sink. He cried out, &quot;Lord, save me!&quot;","10":"Jesus reached out right away and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, &quot;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&quot;","11":"When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind immediately stopped. The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him, &quot;Truly you are the Son of God.&quot;"}
