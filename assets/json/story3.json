{"01": "Many years later, many people were living in the world. They had become very wicked and violent. It got so bad that God decided to destroy the whole world with a huge flood.", "02":"God found only one righteous man among all the wicked people. His name was Noah. God told Noah about the flood He was planning to send, and told him to build a huge boat, called an ark.", "03":"God told Noah to make the boat 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, 13.5 meters high. It was to be made of wood and have three levels, many rooms, a roof and a window. The boat would keep Noah, his family, and the animals safe during the flood.", "04":"Noah obeyed the Lord. He and his three sons built the boat just the way God had told them. It took many years to build the boat, because it was so big. Noah warned the people about the coming flood and told them to turn to God, but they just laughed at him.", "05":"They also gathered enough food for themselves and the animals. When everything was ready, God told Noah it was time for him, his wife, his three sons, and their wives to get into the boatâ€”eight people in all.", "06":"God sent a male and a female of every animal and bird to Noah so they could go into the boat and be kept safe during the flood. When they were all in the boat, God Himself closed the door.", "07":"Then it began to rain, and rain, and rain. It rained for forty days and forty nights without stopping! Water also came gushing up out of the earth. Everything in the whole world was covered with water, even the highest mountains.", "08":"Everything that lived on the earth died, except the people and animals who were in the boat, because the boat floated on the water and they were kept safe inside.", "09":"After the rains stopped, it took a long time for the water to go down again.", "10":"The boat floated on the water for seven months, and then one day the boat rested on the top of a mountain. But the world was still covered with water. After three more months, the tops of the mountains were visible.", "11":"Forty days later, Noah sent out a bird called a raven to see if the water had dried up. The raven flew back and forth looking for dry land, but could not find any dry land.", "12":"Later Noah sent out a bird called a dove. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to Noah.", "13":"A week later he sent the dove out again, and it came back with an olive branch in its beak! The water was going down and the plants were growing again!", "14":"Noah waited another week and sent out the dove a third time. This time, it did not come back. The water had dried up!", "15":"Two months later, God told Noah that it was time to open the door and leave the boat with his family and all the animals. Noah obeyed.", "16":"After he got off the boat, Noah built an altar and offered a sacrifice to God.", "17":"God was happy with the sacrifice and blessed Noah and his family. He said, &quot;Have many children and fill the earth.&quot; God also promised that He would never again destroy the earth with water.","18":"God then made the first rainbow as a sign of His promise. Every time the rainbow was in the sky, God would remember what He promised, and so would His people."}
