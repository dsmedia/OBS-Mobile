{"01":"After Joshua died, the Israelites disobeyed God and did not drive out the rest of the Canaanites. The Israelites began to worship the Canaanite gods instead of the One True God. The Israelites had no king, so everyone did what they thought was right for them.","02":"As a result of this disobedience, God punished His people Israel by allowing them to be defeated by the people from neighboring countries. These enemies would steal from the Israelites, destroy their property, and kill them. After many years, the Israelites would repent and ask God to rescue them.","03":"Then God would provide a deliverer who would rescue them from their enemies and bring peace to the land. But the people would always forget about God and start worshiping idols again. This pattern of sin, punishment, repentance, and deliverance was repeated many times.","04":"One time when the Israelites started worshiping idols, God allowed the Midianites to defeat them. These enemies took all of their crops for seven years. The Israelites hid in caves so the Midianites would not find them. Finally, they cried out to God to save them.","05":"One day, a man named Gideon was secretly harvesting grain so the Midianites would not steal it. The angel of God came to Gideon and said, &quot;God is with you, Mighty warrior. Go and save Israel from the Midianites.&quot;","06":"God told Gideon to tear down his father&rsquo;s idol. Gideon was afraid of the people, so he waited until night, then he tore down the idol and smashed it to pieces. He built an altar to God where the idol used to be and sacrificed an offering to God.","07":"The next morning the people saw that the idol had been torn down and they were very angry. They went to Gideon&rsquo;s house to kill him, but Gideon&rsquo;s father said, &quot;Why are you trying to help your gods? If they are gods, let them protect themselves!&quot; So Gideon was saved.","08":"Then the Midianites came to steal from the Israelites. There were so many of them that they could not be counted. Gideon called the people together to fight them. Gideon asked God for two signs so that he could be sure that God would use him to save Israel.","09":"First, he laid a cloth on the ground and asked God to let dew fall only on the cloth and not on the ground. God did that. The next night, he asked that the ground be wet but the cloth dry. God did that too.","10":"Gideon had 32,000 soldiers, but God told him this was too many. So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were too scared to fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent all of them home except for 300 soldiers.","11":"God told Gideon, &quot;Go down to the Midianite camp and when you hear what they say, you will no longer be afraid.&quot; So Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier tell about a dream that said Gideon would win the battle. Gideon worshiped God.","12":"Gideon gave each of his soldiers a horn, a clay pot and a torch. That night, they surrounded the place where the Midianites were sleeping. The 300 men had the torches in the pots so they could not be seen.","13":"Then, at the same time, they all broke the pots that were hiding the torches. They blew their horns and shouted, &quot;A sword for God and for Gideon!&quot;","14":"God confused the Midianites, so that they attacked each other and started killing each other.","15":"Immediately, the rest of the Israelites were called from their homes to come help defeat the Midianites. They killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of their land. God saved Israel that day.","16":"The people wanted to make Gideon their king. Gideon wisely refused their offer, but he asked them for some of the money that each of them had taken from the enemy. Gideon received a lot of money.","17":"Then Gideon did a foolish thing. He made an idol with the money, and the people turned away from God again. They started worshiping Gideon&rsquo;s idol.","18":"So God again punished Israel for their sin and allowed their enemies to defeat them. Finally, the people cried out to God. God sent another deliverer.","19":"The people followed God for a time, but then they sinned and worshiped idols again. Many deliverers saved Israel from their enemies. But the Israelites always forgot God and began worshiping idols again. God wanted to give the Israelites a godly king who would lead them and encourage them to always follow God.","20":"But the people asked God for a king like all the other nations had. They wanted a king who was tall, mighty and could lead them into battle. God did not like this request, but He gave them what they wanted."}
