{"01":"When God created the world, everything was perfect. There was no sin. Adam and Eve loved each other and they loved God. There was no death or sickness or pain. This was the way God wanted things to be.","02":"Satan, who was the snake in the garden, deceived Eve, and she and Adam sinned against God. Because they sinned, death, sickness, and pain all became part of life for everyone on earth.","03":"Even worse, their relationship with God was broken. Everyone is born an enemy of God because of sin.","04":"Satan thought he had won, but God had a plan. God promised that Eve&rsquo;s descendant would crush Satan&rsquo;s head. This meant that Satan would kill Jesus, but God would raise him to life after three days. Jesus would crush the power of Satan forever.","05":"When God destroyed the whole earth in the flood, He provided the boat as a way of salvation for those who believed Him. In the same way, though everyone deserves to be destroyed for their sins, God has provided a way of salvation for everyone who believes in Jesus.","06":"God told Abraham, &quot;Through you, all the nations of the earth will be blessed.&quot; Jesus was a descendant of Abraham. All the nations of the earth are blessed through Jesus because everyone who believes in him becomes one of God&rsquo;s chosen people.","07":"Melchizedek was a priest who blessed Abraham. Like Melchizedek, Jesus is a priest. Jesus is the great High Priest who offered himself as a perfect, sinless sacrifice to take away the sin of the whole world.","08":"God provided a ram for Abraham to sacrifice instead of Isaac. Everyone deserves to die for their sins, including you! But God provided Jesus as a sacrifice to die instead of you.","09":"When God sent the last plague on Egypt, the Israelites needed to kill a perfect lamb and spread the blood around their doors. When the angel of death saw the blood, he passed over their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons.","10":"Jesus is our Passover Lamb. He was perfect and sinless and was killed at the Passover Feast. When anyone believes in Jesus, the blood of Jesus washes away that person&rsquo;s sin, and God's punishment passes over him.","11":"God made a covenant with the Israelites which made them His chosen people. But, in God&rsquo;s New Covenant, anyone from any nation can become part of God&rsquo;s chosen people by believing in Jesus.","12":"Moses was a great prophet who proclaimed the Word of God. Like Moses, Jesus is a prophet, but Jesus is the greatest prophet, who is the Word of God.","13":"God promised David that the Messiah would be one of his descendants. Jesus, the Messiah, was a descendant of David.","14":"Like David, Jesus is a king. Jesus is the king of the universe! He will come again and rule the world with justice and peace.","15":"Jesus&rsquo; mother, Mary, was a virgin when He was born because Jesus was God&rsquo;s Son. Jesus is both God and man at the same time.","16":"Jesus did many miracles proving he is God. He walked on water, calmed storms, healed many sick people, drove out demons, raised the dead to life, and fed 5,000 people with five loaves of bread and two fish.","17":"Jesus was also a great teacher. He taught that you need to love your neighbor as you love yourself.","18":"He also taught that you need to love God more than anything else, including your wealth.","19":"Jesus taught that salvation is worth more than anything else in the world.","20":"He taught that not all people will receive him and be saved. Those who are not saved will be gathered at the end of the world and burned in hell.","21":"Jesus taught that God loves sinners very much. He is ready to forgive them and make them His children.","22":"Jesus also taught that everyone in the world has sinned and is separated from God. Because of their sin, no one can have a relationship with God. God hates sin.","23":"But God loved the world so much that gave His only son, Jesus, so that whoever believes in Him will not go to hell but will live with Him forever in heaven.","24":"Jesus chose to die as a perfect, sinless sacrifice to take away your sins and the sins of the whole world. Because of Jesus, any sin can be forgiven, no matter what it is.","25":"When Jesus died on the cross, he received your punishment. Because of your sin, you are guilty. You deserve death and God's anger. But God&rsquo;s anger was poured out on Jesus instead.","26":"No one can be saved by doing good things. Nothing you do can fix your relationship with God. Your sins can only be washed away if you believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and that he died and rose again to take away your sins.","27":"Anyone who believes in Jesus will be saved. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, man or woman, old or young, or where you are from. God loves you and wants you to believe in Jesus so he can have a relationship with you.","28":"Do you believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the only Son of God? Do you believe that you are a sinner and deserve God&rsquo;s punishment? Do you believe that Jesus died on the cross to take away your sins? If not, come to Jesus and believe in him now.","29":"If you believe this, you are a Christian! God has taken you out of Satan&rsquo;s kingdom of darkness and put you in God&rsquo;s kingdom of light. All the old things are gone, because God makes all things new.","30":"If you a Christian, your sins are forgiven and Jesus has given you his own sinless perfection! Now, when God looks at you, He does not see your sins. Instead, He sees the perfect blood of Jesus and his righteousness as though it was your own.","31":"Even though you are a Christian, you will still struggle with sin. But God says if you confess your sins, He is faithful and will forgive you. Jesus will give you strength to fight against sin.","32":"God tells Christians to pray, study His Word, and worship Him with other Christians. All of these things help you to grow in your relationship with God."}
